# Password Generator
 A secure password generator with user configuration.

This password generator was created by modifying starter-code. It will prompt the user as to which character types they wish to include in the generated password, as well as the length of the password.

The password generator uses dynamically generated HTML via JavaScript.

This application allows users to easily generate secure passwords.
